                    <h1>Let’s Help Those Who Are
                         More In Need</h1>
                    <p>One of the better ways to help the poor and needy people is to give them a hand up rather than a
                         hand
                         out.
                         Giving them moral support, showing heartfelt humility and respect makes them aware that someone
                         really
                         does care about them and trying to improve their condition.</p>

               <h1>Our Donate Plan</h1>
               <p>A voluntary gift or contribution for a specific cause. A gift or grant. The definition of a donation
                    is
                    money or some other item of value given to a charity or a person in need. When you give a charity
                    for the
                    homeless a $100 check, this is an example of a $100 donation.</p>

                    <h3>Food for a family</h3>
                    <p>Through food, we learn about cooking and nutrition, meal planning, money management, and smart
                         shopping.
                         Food provides opportunities for families to learn about responsibility and chores and about
                         working
                         and
                         sharing time together. Clearly food plays a greater role than simply nourishing our bodies.</p>

                    <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
                    <p>Shelter is a basic human need crucial for survival in cases of natural hazards or conflict. It
                         provides security, personal safety and protection from the weather, and prevents ill health and
                         disease. Adequate housing provides people with dignity and the opportunity to lead a normal
                         life.

                    <h3>Education for a child</h3>
                    <p>Education develops critical thinking. This is vital in teaching a person how to use logic when
                         making
                         decisions and interacting with people (e.g., boosting creativity, enhancing time management).
                         Education helps an individual meet basic job qualifications and makes them more likely to
                         secure
                         better jobs.</p>
